## 📊 About Me  

I work with data to uncover patterns, generate actionable insights, and support informed decision-making.  

My focus lies in transforming raw datasets into structured, analysis-ready formats and building clear, meaningful visual reports that communicate business performance effectively.  

Through hands-on projects and analytical problem-solving, I have developed a strong understanding of:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning workflows  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- KPI tracking and performance analysis  
- Dashboard development and reporting automation  
- Insight communication for non-technical stakeholders  

I approach every dataset with a structured mindset — understanding the problem first, then extracting insights that truly matter.
